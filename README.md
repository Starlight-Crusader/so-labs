If you are a FAF student exploring this code to finish your own project, at least star this repository; I don’t think the professor will check this, so let’s farm me the achievement xD

For my fellow teammates: <br>
~ Run build_task2 to create an image with the program <br>
~ You can use the T2 program to do things described in the first task <br>
~ Some usefull UNIX commands for debugging:

    hexdump -c F - display the contents of F in hexadecimal;
    cat F | tr -cd 'X' | wc -c - count the number of occurrences of the character X in the file F
